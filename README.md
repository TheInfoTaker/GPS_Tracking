# Overview

This project represents a custom map software developed as part of a learning journey in software engineering. The software is designed to display and utilize location data, making it a valuable tool for tracking and managing geographical information.

## Description

The map software developed in this project allows users to access and interact with location data. It provides features for tracking and managing geographical information, including real-time GPS data, waypoints, and address geocoding.

### Features:
- Display latitude and longitude coordinates.
- Show altitude and accuracy of location data.
- Present the speed of the device if available.
- Switch between GPS and network-based location services.
- Store waypoints for future reference.
- Geocode street addresses based on latitude and longitude coordinates.
- Displays a list of saved waypoints.
- Has a feature to visualize location data on a map.
- Periodic location updates.

The source of the location data primarily comes from the device's GPS and network-based location services. Additionally, geocoding of street addresses is accomplished using the Android Geocoder.

## Purpose

The main objective of this software project is to enhance skills in Android app development and deepen understanding of location-based services. The software serves as a learning tool for software engineering and as a practical utility for users interested in GPS tracking and waypoint management.
